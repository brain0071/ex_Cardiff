# CUCR Lab Demos (Franka). How to Use:

## After the installation, follow these step.


1- Select the appropriate kernel by navigating to "Advanced Options" in Ubuntu and choosing version 5.9.1-rt20 (while restarting the computer).

2- For the username and password, contact to Furkan Duman (dumanf@cardiff.ac.uk).

3- If the IP address is not set via the robot interface, access the (https://robot.franka.de) website to configure the robot's IP address. Then, set a different IP address in the computer's settings (see Franka's instructions for more details (https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/getting_started.html)).

If the IP address is already set, proceed directly to the IP address website and ensure that the cable is connected to the robot's driver.

4- Activate FCI, unlock the joints, and re-initialize the gripper to prepare for use.

5- The system is now ready for use with ROS.
